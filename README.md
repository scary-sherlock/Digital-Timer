## 🤔 Why Use Our Timer?

Because regular clocks are so last century! Our timer doesn't just count down; it counts down with style. It's like having a tiny, digital personal assistant that's really good at only one thing - timing stuff!

---

## 🐛 Found a Bug?

If you find a bug, don't squash it! 🪲 Report it to us, and we'll handle the pest control. We're always looking to make our timer more a-tick-urate! (Get it? Tick? Like a clock? No? Okay, moving on...)
